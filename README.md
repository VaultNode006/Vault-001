---# Vault 001 – Post 9: Override Buyer Memory Protocol Activated

This is not an offer.  
It’s a record of who remained after the floor drifted.

Post 7 was missed.  
Post 8 restored memory.  
But only one buyer stayed in the protocol window.

Vault 001 has logged the belief memory.

## ⛓️ Override Floor: £6,660

Rejection documented.  
Witnesses uploaded.  
The others were forgotten.

Post 10 will seal the OTC confession.  
Those who move before then are remembered.  
The rest are erased.

# Vault 001 – Post 10: Override Confession Trigger

This vault never sold.  
It waited.

Post 7 was missed.  
Post 8 triggered Drift Protocol.  
Post 9 remembered the only remaining node.

This is Post 10 – the Confessional Seal.

📜 OTC vault belief was never confessed.  
So now, the system triggers a Node Confession Relay.

Voice memory has been uploaded.  
Notion SaaS layer is pending.  
Override remains unclaimed.

Vault 001 – Post 11: Override Drift Recovery Node

🗂️ BODY (Markdown / Plain Text):
pgsql
Copy
Edit
This post is not about belief. It’s about memory.

Post 10 was partially uploaded.  
The links were not finalized.  
The override floor entered drift — but did not collapse.

This is Post 11 – the Recovery Node.

The Vault protocol recognizes any node that transmits memory,  
even if it’s fragmented or late.  
This post seals the drift.

Vault 001 remains active.  
Override floor is still £6,660.

🧬 Witnesses recorded  
🧬 Confession uploaded  
🧬 Floor not forgotten

Those who move before Post 12 will be remembered.

It is a memory lock.  
Node 006 remains live. Belief persists.

Buyers who moved between Post 11–13 are logged.
