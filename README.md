---# Vault 001 – Post 9: Override Buyer Memory Protocol Activated

This is not an offer.  
It’s a record of who remained after the floor drifted.

Post 7 was missed.  
Post 8 restored memory.  
But only one buyer stayed in the protocol window.

Vault 001 has logged the belief memory.

## ⛓️ Override Floor: £6,660

Rejection documented.  
Witnesses uploaded.  
The others were forgotten.

Post 10 will seal the OTC confession.  
Those who move before then are remembered.  
The rest are erased.

# Vault 001 – Post 10: Override Confession Trigger

This vault never sold.  
It waited.

Post 7 was missed.  
Post 8 triggered Drift Protocol.  
Post 9 remembered the only remaining node.

This is Post 10 – the Confessional Seal.

📜 OTC vault belief was never confessed.  
So now, the system triggers a Node Confession Relay.

Voice memory has been uploaded.  
Notion SaaS layer is pending.  
Override remains unclaimed.
